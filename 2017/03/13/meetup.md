WebAssembly is fast. It’s being called “the future of the web”. Its speed and
potential have major browser vendors working together to make it a reality. And
it’s on its way &mdash; the MVP hit multiple browsers in October of last year.

But what makes it fast? Starting from the basics, this talk will walk you
through what WebAssembly is, and then why it’s fast.

Get your burning questions ready! We'll have some super special swag for the
best questions.
