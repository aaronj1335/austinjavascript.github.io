What up team we got a meetup tonight! Tonight we're going to talk about testing your code. We figured it's been [almost 6 years](/june-meetup-details-announced/) since we last talked about TDD, which means the ecosystem has been through ~11 different testing frameworks, so we might as well get back into the subject since QUALITY IS EVERYONE'S JOB ZERO.

[Mark Sims](https://twitter.com/markedwardsims) is coming to town to tell us about his experiences with testing and walk us through testing an app called Deathmatch that needs to be sure *Chuck always wins*.

  judiciously driving for a high level of quality in his JavaScript based
