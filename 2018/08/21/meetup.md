Simon has been building browser based simulations such as
[coldwar.io](https://coldwar.io) and
[ratsofthemaze.com](https://ratsofthemaze.com) over the past few years,
showcasing them at numerous JS Confs and our own TXJS. Since he's in town this
week, he's going to give us a casual retrospective on this work and a dive into
some of the code.

### Special Guest Host

Lon and Andrew are off to JSConf US and Aaron is taking a sabbatical to finish
his upcoming definitive book on `ConcreteAbstractFactoryAdapterImplementations`,
so [Rebecca Murphey][] has graciously offered to come out of retirement and host
this month's event.

Make sure to thank our gracious hosts [Spredfast][], and our sponsors
[Indeed Prime][] for the food and drinks!
