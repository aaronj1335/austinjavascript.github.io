For our final meetup of 2k15 we have a very special guest: [Joe McCann][], founder of AustinJS and [NodeSource][], is going to talk about this [Node.js][] thing we've heard so much about. Node recently went straight from 0.12 to 4.0, meaning it is 33.3X more Enterprise Ready&trade;&reg;&copy;&#8480; than competing platforms. Joe will tell us everything we need to know to scale Node out the front door and into the cloud.
