Grid frameworks in CSS help keep a product, department, or even a whole company visually aligned.
However, they can be a struggle to maintain while satisfying different experiencesâ€™ needs.

new open-source package that generates grid frameworks, we will cover:

* Abstracting design specs for reusable code
* Performance vs CSS browser support
* The flexibility of isomorphic JavaScript packages
